# Gas system

Every user starts with 1 CAR and 1 GAS cap. Owing 1 car NFT grants you 1 gas that can be used for 1 race. Merging them increases the gas cap and ability to earn more reward tokens via participating in more races. A single race burns 1 gas.

The burnt gas replenishes 20% every 6 hours. This ensures users can enter limited amount of race which is in tandem with the amount they have
