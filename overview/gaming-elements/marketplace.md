Marketplace will also be available on third-party NFT Marketplaces on Bitgert chain. This will only allow buying and selling of NFT cars on such third party Marketplace.

Buying/Selling or Leasing/Renting of NFT cars utilize Bpad token as well as Brise. Users can trade using Bpad on MetaRace DaPP with brise used on third-party Marketplace.

### Rental System

In order to provide easy onboarding, users will be able to put their NFT cars up for rent allowing others to lease at a an affordable rate for certain period of time.

Provision of a rent/lease system makes it easy for users to explore the game without purchasing NFT cars. It also provides added income for NFT cars owners to generate passive income by leasing their car out.

Users can lease car from list of rents available. There is a rental agreement that includes number of days and the rent rate for all leasers to choose from. The rental agreement is made by the NFT car owner.
